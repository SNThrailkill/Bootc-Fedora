# Bootc Examples (Fedora)

This repo contains some examples of how someone can use bootable containers to deploy a wide
variety of applications. The base images in this repo are based off the [Fedora bootc image](https://quay.io/repository/fedora/fedora-bootc?tab=tags). All images come with `distrobox`, `cloud-init`, and `cockpit`.

The `Containerfile` contains multiple stages that can be used to get exactly the software you need. See [Multi-stage Builds](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-stage/) documentation for more information on how this works.

## Nginx
This quadlet is preconfigured to pull in a preconfigured `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` at the same path. It will not work until you add that file into your filesystem. 

## Pihole
This quadlet will work out of the box but because there's no way to include secrets as part of the quadlet definition you will have to `podman exec` into the pod and change the password manually by running `pihole -a -p` to set a password. This is a one time operation.
